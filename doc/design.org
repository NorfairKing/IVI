* Design
** Main principles
   - Intelligence

     IVI is not intelligent, but she simulates the recognition of natural language to interface with her scripts.
   
   - Modularity
  
     IVI is designed to be modular. Nothing should ever break if a component is upgraded.

   - Scripts
    
     Most of IVI's functionality comes from her scripts.
     She is therefor designed so that new scripts can be easily added on.

   - Documentation and testing
   
     IVI is extensively documented and tested.

** Features
*** Command Recognition
    IVi is used directly using the command line.
    She is supposed to respond to regular sentences, as wel as specific commands.

** Scripts
