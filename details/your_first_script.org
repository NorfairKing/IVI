* Your first script
  To write your first IVI script, please refer to the [[https://github.com/NorfairKing/IVIScriptTemplate][script template repository]].

  When writing your script, please take the time to consider the following:
  - The name of your script directory *must* start with a capital letter.
  - The best practice is to make your script directroy a git repository so that you can keep up with IVI updates.
    (You don't need to put every script in a seperate repository.)
