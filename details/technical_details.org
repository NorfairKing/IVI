** Scripts
   Scripts are never included in the IVI repository.
   Scripts are developped independently, based on the IVI API.

   A script consists of the following elements

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
ScriptDirectory
|- script.ivi
|- Script.hs
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Script Directory
    Prerequisites
    - The script directory name *must* start with a capital letter.
    
    Notes
    - The script directory name should use Pascal casing.
      example:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
AVeryLongScriptDirectoryNameExample
#+END_EXAMPLE

*** Source file
    Each IVI
